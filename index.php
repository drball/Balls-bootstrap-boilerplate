                        the current mission. Crew sit at different desks on a swivelly chair and can work at either the
                        communications, navigation, engineering or scanning computers.</p>

                        ship. After the 3 million years in stasis all these shops are now abandoned, and the Promenade has
                        been inhabited by a collection of evolved rodents called “The Vermin”.</p>

                        reactor is a nuclear core held in place by vital Drive Plates, it was due to these cracking that
                        caused the leak of Cadmium II.<br>
